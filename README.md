# Ricardo

### 1. Introduction
  Ricardo is an open-source robot which aim is to make replicating it an easy and fun process
  so that anyone who is interested in robotics can get into the field and progress.
  Ricardo is fully 3D printable and uses some 3D models from thingiverse. The electronics are
  all readily available and relatively cheap such as the Raspberry Pi and other Arduino modules
  which make upgrading and repairing him an easy process.
  This document contains a guide in the following sections on all of the parts and how they are
  connected so that you can easily start making your own Ricardo.
  The README file shall be updated consistently with new changes and it is the documentation 
  for the entire project.
    
### 2. Project structure
  #### 1. Files 
  The repository consists of several python scripts which will need to be runned from the
  Raspberry Pi for all of this to work. You need this repository cloned on your Raspberry Pi.
  The scripts can be divided into two categories: **user driven** and **AI driven**.
  In the user driven scripts (ex: robot_control.py) the user inputs commands in order to
  control the robot. In the AI driven scripts the AI controls the robot either entirely or lets
  the user also have some control.
